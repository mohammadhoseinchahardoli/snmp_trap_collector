EVENT cpqNicConnectivityRestored .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.0.18001 "Status Events" INFORMATIONAL
FORMAT NIC Status Trap (18001): Connectivity is restored for adapter in slot $3, port $4.
SDESC
This trap will be sent any time connectivity is restored
to a logical adapter.  This occurs when the physical
adapter in a single adapter configuration returns to
the OK condition or at least one physical adapter
in a logical adapter group returns to the OK condition.
This can be caused by replacement of a faulty cable
or re-attaching a cable that was unplugged.
User Action: None required.

EVENT cpqNicConnectivityLost .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.0.18002 "Status Events" MAJOR
FORMAT NIC Status Trap (18002): Connectivity lost for adapter in slot $3, port $4.
SDESC
This trap will be sent any time the status of a logical
adapter changes to the Failed condition.  This occurs
when the adapter in a single adapter configuration fails,
or when the last adapter in a redundant configuration fails.
This can be caused by loss of link due to a cable being
removed from the adapter or the Hub or Switch.  Internal
adapter, Hub, or Switch failures can also cause this
condition.
User Action: Check the cables to the adapter and the Hub or
Switch.  If no cable problems are found, the adapter, Hub,
or Switch may need replacement.

EVENT cpqNicRedundancyIncreased .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.0.18003 "Status Events" INFORMATIONAL
FORMAT NIC Status Trap (18003): Redundancy increased by adapter in slot $3, port $4.
SDESC
This trap will be sent any time a previously failed physical
adapter in a connected logical adapter group returns to the OK
condition.  This trap is not sent when a logical adapter
group has connectivity restored from a Failed condition.  The
cpqNicConnectivityRestored trap is sent instead.
This can be caused by replacement of a faulty cable
or re-attaching a cable that was unplugged.

FORMAT NIC Status Trap (18004): Redundancy decreased by adapter in slot $3, port $4.
SDESC
This trap will be sent any time a physical adapter in a
logical adapter group changes to the Failed condition, but
at least one physical adapter remains in the OK condition..
This can be caused by loss of link due to a cable being
removed from the adapter or the Hub or Switch.  Internal
adapter, Hub, or Switch failures can also cause this
condition.
User Action: Check the cables to the adapter and the Hub or
Switch.  If no cable problems are found, the adapter, Hub,
