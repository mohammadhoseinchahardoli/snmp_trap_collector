EVENT cpqSmAlertDestinationBlacklisted .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.4.0.7 "Status Events" MINOR
FORMAT Alert Destination Blacklisted: Phone# $2, Pager ID $3 blacklisted.
SDESC
Alert destination blacklisted.
The Server Manager board modem has blacklisted an alert 
destination phone number.  Once blacklisted, that alert 
destination is no longer available for use as an alert 
destination.  Blacklisting, which only occurs in 
international modems, is a requirement imposed by certain 
European countries on modems, to prevent a phone number 
from being dialed multiple times without getting a connection.  
The number of attempts required to have blacklisting occur,
vary from country to country.  Once an alert destination has 
been blacklisted, the only way to remove the blacklisted phone 
number is to remove power from the modem.  
On external modems this is a trival task.  When a blacklisting
occurs on the Server Manager board's internal modem the
task is slightly more difficult as the modem gets power 
from the Server Manager board.  
To remove power from the Server Manager board's internal modem,
the Server Manager board must be forced into Dormant Mode.
This is an operating mode, used to conserve battery life,
which is entered automatically if the board looses power.
To cause the board to enter Dormant Mode, the following
steps should be performed:
1) Disable alerting via CPQCAUI.NLM.
2) Disable async communication via CPQCAUI.NLM.
3) Down the server.
4) Exit to DOS (if applicable).
5) Shut power off to the computer.
6) Wait 5 minutes before restoring power.
Once the 5 minutes has expired, and power to the computer
has been restored, the modem will have flushed its
blacklist, and the board's alerting functions will work
as expected.
