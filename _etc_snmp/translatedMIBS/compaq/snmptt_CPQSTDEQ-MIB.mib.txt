EVENT cpqSeCpuThresholdPassed .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.0.1001 "Status Events" MINOR
FORMAT CPU error threshold passed (1001): CPU internal corrected errors have passed a set threshold.
SDESC
This trap is sent when an internal CPU error threshold has been
passed on a particular CPU causing it to go degraded. This trap
will be sent when cpqSeCpuThreshPassed transitions from false to
true.

EVENT cpqSePCCardThermalDegraded .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.0.1002 "Status Events" MAJOR
FORMAT PC Card Thermal Degraded Status (1002): Safe PC Card $5 Thermal operating conditions exceeded.
SDESC
This trap is sent when the PC Card Slot Thermal Sensor threshold has been
exceeded for safe operations thereby causing degraded operations. This trap
will be sent when cpqSePCCardStatus transitions from Normal (1) to Thermal
Degraded (2).
The manufacturer and product information strings as well as the slot number
for the degraded PC Card is provided as parameters for this trap.

EVENT cpqSePCCardThermalFailure .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.0.1003 "Status Events" CRITICAL
FORMAT PC Card Thermal Failure Status (1003): Degraded PC Card $5 Thermal operating conditions exceeded.
SDESC
This trap is sent when the PC Card Slot Thermal Sensor threshold has been
exceeded for degraded operations thereby causing failed operations.
This trap will be sent when cpqSePCCardStatus transitions from Thermal Degraded
(2) to Thermal Failure (3).
The manufacturer and product information strings as well as the slot number
for the failed PC Card is provided as parameters for this trap.

EVENT cpqSePCCardThermalSafe .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.0.1004 "Status Events" INFORMATIONAL
FORMAT PC Card Thermal Safe Operations Status (1004): Degraded/Failed PC Card $3 Thermal conditions restored to Safe operations.
SDESC
This trap is sent when the PC Card Slot Thermal Sensor threshold has been
crossed which restored the thermal status to normal operations. This trap will be sent
when cpqSePCCardStatus transitions from Thermal Degraded (2) or Thermal Failure
(3) to Normal (1).
The number of the recovered PC Card slot is provided as a parameter for this trap.

FORMAT CPU error threshold passed (1005): CPU internal corrected errors have passed a set threshold.
SDESC
This trap is sent when an internal CPU error threshold has been
passed on a particular CPU causing it to go degraded. This trap
will be sent when cpqSeCpuThreshPassed transitions from false to
true.
