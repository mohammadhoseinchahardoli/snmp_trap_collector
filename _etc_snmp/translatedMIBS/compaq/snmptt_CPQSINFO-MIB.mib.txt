EVENT cpqSiHoodRemoved .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.0.2001 "Status Events" MAJOR
FORMAT System hood is removed (2001): Hood is removed from unit.
SDESC
System hood is removed.
The hood status has been set to removed.  The
system's hood is not in a properly installed state. This
situation may result in improper cooling of the system due
to air flow changes caused by the missing hood.
User Action: Replace the cover (hood), ensure the system's cover
is properly installed. Verify the system is in working order.

EVENT cpqSiMonitorConditionDegraded .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.0.2003 "Status Events" MINOR
FORMAT Monitor Condition Degraded (2003) : The monitor's condition has been set to degraded.
SDESC
A fault reporting feature has exceeded normal limits for
the monitor indicated by the cpqSiMonitorIndex. The monitor's
condition is degraded due to the internal temperature exceeding
normal operating limits.  The monitor is still useable, but
action should be taken to return the condition to OK.
User Action: Physically check for obstructions to air flow around
the monitor.  Check the thermostat in the room that the system
occupies.  Allow the monitor to cool by turning off the monitor
for 5 minutes then turn the monitor back on.  After the monitor
cools, another alarm indicating an improving condition, such as
Monitor OK, will be issued.

SDESC
A fault reporting feature has exceeded normal limits in the
monitor indicated by the cpqSiMonitorIndex. The monitor's
condition has been set to failed due to an operational feature
exceeding normal operating limits.  The monitor will not be
useable and should be replaced.
