EVENT swFault .1.3.6.1.4.1.1588.2.1.1.1.0.1 "Status Events" CRITICAL
FORMAT Switch is faulty.: Faulty reason: $1 and SSN is #$2,GroupName $3,GroupType $4,GroupMemPosition $5
SDESC
Obsoleted this trap as firmware doesn't support this trap.
A swFault(1) is generated whenever the diagnostics
detects a fault with the switch.
Variables:
  1: swDiagResult
  2: swSsn
  3: swGroupName
  4: swGroupType
  5: swGroupMemPos

EVENT swSensorScn .1.3.6.1.4.1.1588.2.1.1.1.0.2 "Status Events" INFORMATIONAL
FORMAT A sensor (temperature, fan, etc.) changed its operational state.: $5: is currently in state $1 and SSN is #$6
SDESC
A swSensorScn(2) is generated whenever an
environment sensor changes its operational state. For instance,
a fan stop working. The VarBind in the Trap Data Unit shall
contain the corresponding instance of the sensor
status, sensor index, sensor type, sensor value (reading)
and sensor information. Note that the sensor information
contains the type of sensor and its number in textual format.
Variables:
  1: swSensorStatus
  2: swSensorIndex
  3: swSensorType
  4: swSensorValue
  5: swSensorInfo
  6: swSsn

EVENT swFCPortScn .1.3.6.1.4.1.1588.2.1.1.1.0.3 "Status Events" INFORMATIONAL
FORMAT A Fibre Channel Port changed its operational state.: Port Index $2 changed state to $1  Port Name: $3 and SSN is #$4
SDESC
A swFCPortScn(3) is generated whenever an FC_Port
changes its operational state. For instance, the FC_Port
goes from on-line to offline. The VarBind in the Trap Data
Unit shall contain the corresponding instance of the
FC_Port's operational status, index, swFCPortName,swSsn and
swFCPortFlag. swSsn is optional varbind sent when swExtTrap
is also enabled. The three arguments swGroupName, swGroupType,
swGroupMemPos belong to swGroup table which is obsolete
and not implemented.
Variables:
  1: swFCPortOpStatus
  2: swFCPortIndex
  3: swFCPortName
  4: swSsn
  5: swFCPortFlag
  6: swGroupName
