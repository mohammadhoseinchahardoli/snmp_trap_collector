The required registry entry for determining the role of the 'sysadmin' user
was missing from the registry. This entry is required for the 'sysadmin' user

privileges hence cannot perform certain critical/important operations. This
may cause the system unusable.
Due to the possible in-correctable consequences this condition may cause,
DDSH has auto-corrected the issue by adding the missing entry back in the
registry so the 'sysadmin' user can still function. However, there might
be issues still if there are other registry entries that are missing.

In the worst case this can take 15-20 days for 280 TBs. It means 
that the system will not run at full speed for that period of

sanitization will also reclaim space back but it might not be 
as efficient as GC is.
Action: 
Make sure that you have enough space to not run out of space and
that you can wait that many days in the worst case. You should have
at least 20% of physical space available. Other option is
to abort sanitization, delete a bunch of files and try again. You can
do this process iteratively until you do not get this alert anymore.
