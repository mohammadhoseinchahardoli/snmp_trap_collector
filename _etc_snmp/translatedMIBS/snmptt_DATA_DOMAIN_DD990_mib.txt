Indicates that sanitization will be run in multiple iterations.
In the worst case this can take 15-20 days for 280 TBs. It means 
that the system will not run at full speed for that period of 
time and that GC will not be run to reclaim space. However, 
sanitization will also reclaim space back but it might not be 
as efficient as GC is.
Action: 
Make sure that you have enough space to not run out of space and
that you can wait that many days in the worst case. You should have
at least 20% of physical space available. Other option is
to abort sanitization, delete a bunch of files and try again. You can
do this process iteratively until you do not get this alert anymore.
