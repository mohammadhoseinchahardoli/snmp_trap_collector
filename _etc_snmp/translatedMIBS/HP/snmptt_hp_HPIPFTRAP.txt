EVENT hpevtIpmiBmc2hostMsgFailure .1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.23.35.0.8153 "Status Events" WARNING
FORMAT An error occurred while transmitting an IPMI message in the BMC2HOST direction.
SDESC
This event indicates that an error occurred while transmitting an IPMI message in the BMC2HOST direction. The data field contains more detailed information about the source of the error. Data Bytes 0 & 1 form a 16-bit IPMI error indicator that has the following values and meanings:  1 - IPMI_HOST_BUSY_TIMEOUT - The PDHC could not put a message in the BMC2HOST hardware message queue for over 10 seconds, so the pending message(s) were dropped.  2 - IPMI_INVALID_MSG_SIZE - The MP sent an IPMI message response that has an embedded size indicator that is less than 4 bytes or greater than the size of the message data. The poorly formed message response will be dropped.  3 - IPMI_BMC2HOST_Q_FULL - The BMC2HOST message queue in the PDHC is full, so a message response from the MP has been dropped.

At a certain point in PDC boot, all of the processors in the partition except the PD monarch are put into a sleep, and they remain there until they are awakened by the PD monarch, at which time they read an architected location in Page Zero to find out where to branch to.  This gives the OS a mechanism by which to bring processors under its control and have it executing OS code.  This chassis log is sent if and when a problem is detected by PDC regarding the contents in the Page Zero location.
