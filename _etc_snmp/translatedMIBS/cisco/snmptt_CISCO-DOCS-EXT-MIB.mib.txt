FORMAT This notification is sent at the completion of a CMTS $*
SDESC
This notification is sent at the completion of a CMTS
channel override operation if 
cdxCmtsCmChOverTrapOnCompletion is true in the
original entry.
Once a channel override operation has been activated, it 
cannot be stopped.  That is, it will run until either the 
CMTS has generated downstream frequency and/or upstream 
channel override fields in the RNG-RSP message sent to a 
cable modem or 
cdxCmtsCmChOverTimeExpiration time expired.
In either case, the operation is completed. State in the 
cdxCmtsCmChOverState object will tell in which 
condition the operation is completed.
Variables:
  1: cdxCmtsCmChOverMacAddress
  2: cdxCmtsCmChOverDownFrequency
  3: cdxCmtsCmChOverUpChannelId
