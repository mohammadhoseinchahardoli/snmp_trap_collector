FORMAT A ciscoPimInterfaceUp notification signifies the  $*
SDESC
A ciscoPimInterfaceUp notification signifies the 
restoration of a PIM interface. This notification
should be generated whenever pimInterfaceStatus
transitions into the 'active' state.
pimInterfaceStatus identifies the interface which 
was involved in the generation of this notification.

FORMAT A ciscoPimInterfaceDown notification signifies the loss $*
SDESC
A ciscoPimInterfaceDown notification signifies the loss
of a PIM interface. This notification should be generated

EVENT ciscoPimRPMappingChange .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.184.2.0.3 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A ciscoPimRPMappingChange notification signifies a change $*
SDESC
A ciscoPimRPMappingChange notification signifies a change
in the RP Mapping on the device in question. A change in RP
Mapping could be because of addition of new entries to the
RP Mapping cache, deletion of existing entries, or a
modification to an existing mapping. The type of change is
indicated by cpimRPMappingChangeType. pimRPSetHoldTime 
is used to identify the row in the pimRPSetTable that is
responsible for the generation of this notification.
In case of modification to existing entries, a
notification should be generated once before the
modification (with cpimRPMappingChangeType set to
modifiedOldMapping) and once after modification (with 
cpimRPMappingChangeType set to modifiedNewMapping).
NOTE: A high frequency of RP Mapping change could result
in a large number of ciscoPimRPMappingChange notifications
being generated. Hence, in environments where the
possibility of a high frequency of RP Mapping change
exists, enable this notification with utmost care.
