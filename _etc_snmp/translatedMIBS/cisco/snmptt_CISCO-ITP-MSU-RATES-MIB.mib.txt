SDESC
This notification is generated once for the interval
specified by the cimrMsuRateNotifyInterval object when the
cimrMsuTrafficRateState object has the following state 
transitions.
'acceptable' ->  'warning'
'acceptable' ->  'overloaded'
'warning'    ->  'overloaded'
At the end of the interval specified by the 
cimrMsuRateNotifyInterval object another notification
will be generated if the current state is 
different from state sent in last notification even if
the state transition is not one of the above transitions.
When the cimrMsuRateNotifyInterval is set to zero all
state changes will generate notifications.
