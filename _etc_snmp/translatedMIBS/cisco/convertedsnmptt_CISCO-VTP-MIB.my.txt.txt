EVENT vtpConfigRevNumberError .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.46.2.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A configuration revision number error notification $*
SDESC
A configuration revision number error notification
signifies that a device has incremented its
vtpConfigRevNumberErrors counter.
Generation of this notification is suppressed if the
vtpNotificationsEnabled has the value 'false'.
The device must throttle the generation of consecutive
vtpConfigRevNumberError notifications so that there is at
least a five-second gap between notification of this type.
When notification are throttled, they are dropped, not
queued for sending at a future time.  (Note that
'generating' a notification means sending to all configured
recipients.)

SDESC
A VTP Server disabled notification is generated when the
local system is no longer able to function as a VTP Server
because the number of defined VLANs is greater than
vtpMaxVlanStorage.
Generation of this notification is suppressed if the
vtpNotificationsEnabled has the value 'false'.

EVENT vtpMtuTooBig .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.46.2.0.4 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A VTP MTU tooBig notification is generated when a VLAN's $*
SDESC
A VTP MTU tooBig notification is generated when a VLAN's
MTU size is larger than can be supported either:
- by one or more of its trunk ports:
the included vtpVlanState has the value
'mtuTooBigForTrunk' and the included
vlanTrunkPortManagementDomain is for the first (or only)
trunk port,
or
- by the device itself:
vtpVlanState has the value 'mtuTooBigForDevice' and any
instance of vlanTrunkPortManagementDomain is included.
Devices which have no trunk ports do not send vtpMtuTooBig
notifications.
Generation of this notification is suppressed if the
vtpNotificationsEnabled has the value 'false'.

FORMAT A VTP version one device detected notification is $*
SDESC
A VTP version one device detected notification is
generated by a device when:
a) a management domain has been put into version 2 mode
(as accessed by managementDomainVersionInUse).
b) 15 minutes has passed since a).
c) a version 1 PDU is detected on a trunk on the device
that is in that management domain which has a lower
revision number than the current configuration.

EVENT vtpVlanRingNumberConflict .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.46.2.0.12 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A VTP ring number configuration conflict notification is $*
SDESC
A VTP ring number configuration conflict notification is
generated if, and only at the time when, a device learns of
a conflict between:
a) the ring number (vtpVlanPortLocalSegment) being used on a
token ring segment attached to the port identified by
ifIndex, and
b) the VTP-obtained ring number (vtpVlanRingNumber) for the
VLAN identified by vtpVlanIndex.
When such a conflict occurs, the bridge port is put into an
administrative down position until the conflict is resolved
through local/network management intervention.
This notification is only applicable to VLANs of type
'tokenRing'.
