EVENT cTapMIBActive .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.252.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This Notification is sent when an intercepting router or $*
SDESC
This Notification is sent when an intercepting router or
switch is first capable of intercepting a packet corresponding
to a configured data stream. If the configured data stream is
an IP one, the value of the corresponding cTapStreamIpStatus 
is included in this notification. If the configured data stream
is an IEEE 802 one, the value of the corresponding 
cTapStream802Status is included in this notification. 
This notification may be generated in conjunction with the
intercept application, which is designed to expect the
notification to be sent as reliably as possible, e.g., through
the use of a finite number of retransmissions until
acknowledged, as and when such mechanisms are available; for
example, with SNMPv3, this would be an InformRequest.  Filter
installation can take a long period of time, during which call
progress may be delayed.

EVENT cTapMediationTimedOut .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.252.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT When an intercept is autonomously removed by an intercepting $*
SDESC
When an intercept is autonomously removed by an intercepting
device, such as due to the time specified in
cTapMediationTimeout arriving, the device notifies the manager
of the action.

EVENT cTapMediationDebug .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.252.0.3 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT When there is intervention needed due to some events related $*
SDESC
When there is intervention needed due to some events related
to entries configured in cTapMediationTable, the device
notifies the manager of the event.
This notification may be generated in conjunction with the
intercept application, which is designed to expect the
notification to be sent as reliably as possible, e.g., through
the use of a finite number of retransmissions until
acknowledged, as and when such mechanisms are available; for
example, with SNMPv3, this would be an InformRequest.
