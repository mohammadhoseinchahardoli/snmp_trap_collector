FORMAT A cc6kxbarIntBusCRCThreshExcdNotif notification $*
SDESC
A cc6kxbarIntBusCRCThreshExcdNotif notification
is sent by the system when the system has
detected that the internal bus CRC error on
a physical entity (such as a module) as specified
by entPhysicalName has exceeded the fatal threshold.

SDESC
A cc6kxbarFlowCtrlBusThrExcdNotif notification
is sent by the system when the system detects the
first occurrence of the system bus flow control FIFO
threshold exceeding on a physical entity

EVENT cc6kxbarTMSwBusUtilAboveNotif .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.217.0.5 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent when the switching bus  $*
SDESC
This notification is sent when the switching bus 
traffic utilization has risen above the configured 
threshold (as specified by 
cc6kxbarTMSwBusUtilThreshold), or has kept staying
above the configured threshold at a logging interval 
(as specified by cc6kxbarTMSwBusUtilLogInterval).

This notification is sent when the switching bus 
traffic utilization has fallen below the configured 
threshold (as specified by 
cc6kxbarTMSwBusUtilThreshold). The varbind 
entPhysicalDescr specifies the physical entity 
(such as chassis) for which the 
cc6kxbarTMSwBusUtilBelowNotif is sent.

SDESC
This notification is sent when the traffic 
utilization on a fabric channel for a given 
traffic direction has risen above its 
corresponding configured threshold (as 
specified by cc6kxbarTMChUtilThreshold), or has 
kept staying above the configured threshold at a 
logging interval (as specified by 
cc6kxbarTMChUtilLogInterval). The varbind 
entPhysicalDescr specifies the physical entity
