EVENT stpxInconsistencyUpdate .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.82.2.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A stpxPortInconsistencyUpdate notification is sent by a $*
SDESC
A stpxPortInconsistencyUpdate notification is sent by a
bridge when an instance of stpxInconsistentState is 
created or destroyed.  That is, when an inconsistency is
discovered in the VLAN's Spanning Tree for a particular 
port, or when such an inconsistency disappears.  Note 
that the trap is not sent if the port transitions between
different types of inconsistency.
The stpxInconsistentState value indicates the type of
inconsistency which now exists/no longer exists for the 
relevant VLAN on the relevant port.
Variables:
  1: stpxInconsistentState

EVENT stpxRootInconsistencyUpdate .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.82.2.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A stpxRootInconsistencyUpdate notification is sent by a $*
SDESC
A stpxRootInconsistencyUpdate notification is sent by a
bridge when an instance of stpxRootInconsistencyState
is created or destroyed. That is, when an
root-inconsistency is discovered in the VLAN's or 
instance's Spanning Tree for a particular port, or when 
such an root-inconsistency disappears. For creation, the 
value of stpxRootInconsistencyState in the notification is
true(1); for deletion, the value is false(2).
The object value of stpxSpanningTreeType indicates
which Spanning Tree protocol is running when an instance 
of stpxRootInconsistencyState is created or destroyed.  
Variables:
  1: stpxRootInconsistencyState
  2: stpxSpanningTreeType

EVENT stpxLoopInconsistencyUpdate .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.82.2.0.3 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A stpxLoopInconsistencyUpdate notification is sent by a $*
SDESC
A stpxLoopInconsistencyUpdate notification is sent by a
bridge when an instance of stpxLoopInconsistencyState
is created or destroyed. That is, when an
loop-inconsistency is discovered in the VLAN's or 
instance's Spanning Tree for a particular port, or when 
such an loop-inconsistency disappears. For creation, 
the value of stpxLoopInconsistencyState in the 
notification is true(1); for deletion, the value is 
false(2).
The object value of stpxSpanningTreeType indicates
which Spanning Tree protocol is running when an instance
of stpxLoopInconsistencyState is created or 
destroyed.
