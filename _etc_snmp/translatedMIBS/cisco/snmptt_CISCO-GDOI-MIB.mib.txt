SDESC
A notification from a Key Srver sent when a GROUPKEY-PUSH

FORMAT An error notification from a Key Server sent when an RSA key $*
SDESC
An error notification from a Key Server sent when an RSA key
is not setup.  Each Key Server and Group Member needs to have
an RSA key established. The Key Server signs the TEK rekeys
using this RSA key, also called a Key Encryption Key (KEK).
The Group Member verifies the authenticity of the TEK rekey
using this RSA key.

SDESC
A notification from a Group Member when it is starting to
register with its GDOI Group's Key Server.  Registration
includes downloading keying & security assosiation material.

SDESC
A notification from a Group Member when it is starting to
re-register with a Key Server in its GDOI Group.  A Group
Member needs to re-register to the key server if its keying & 
security association material has expired and it has not
received a rekey from the key server to refresh the material.
This is equivalent to a Group Member sending the first
message of a GROUPKEY-PULL exchange to the Key Server of a
Group it is already registered with.

configuration is not complete on a Group Member, it will not
be able to  register to the Key Server.
