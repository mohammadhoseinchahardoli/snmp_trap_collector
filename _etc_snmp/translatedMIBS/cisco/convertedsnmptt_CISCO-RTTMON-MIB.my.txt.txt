EVENT rttMonConnectionChangeNotification .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.42.2.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is only valid when the RttMonRttType $*
SDESC
This notification is only valid when the RttMonRttType
is 'echo' or 'pathEcho'.
A rttMonConnectionChangeNotification indicates that a
connection to a target (not to a hop along the path
to a target) has either failed on establishment or 
been lost and when reestablished.  Precisely, this
has resulted in rttMonCtrlOperConnectionLostOccurred
changing value.
If History is not being collected, the instance values 
for the rttMonHistoryCollectionAddress object will not 
be valid.  When RttMonRttType is not 'echo' or 'pathEcho'
the rttMonHistoryCollectionAddress object will be null.

EVENT rttMonTimeoutNotification .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.42.2.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A rttMonTimeoutNotification indicates the occurrence of  $*
SDESC
A rttMonTimeoutNotification indicates the occurrence of 
a timeout for a RTT operation, and it indicates the 
clearing of such a condition by a subsequent RTT 
operation. Precisely, this has resulted in 
rttMonCtrlOperTimeoutOccurred changing value. 
When the RttMonRttType is 'pathEcho', this 
notification will only be sent when the timeout 
occurs during an operation to the target and not to
a hop along the path to the target.  This also 
applies to the clearing of the timeout. 
If History is not being collected, the instance values 
for the rttMonHistoryCollectionAddress object will not 
be valid.  When RttMonRttType is not 'echo' or 'pathEcho'
the rttMonHistoryCollectionAddress object will be null.

EVENT rttMonThresholdNotification .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.42.2.0.3 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A rttMonThresholdNotification indicates the  $*
SDESC
A rttMonThresholdNotification indicates the 
occurrence of a threshold violation for a RTT operation,
and it indicates the previous violation has subsided for
a subsequent RTT operation.  Precisely, this has resulted
in rttMonCtrlOperOverThresholdOccurred changing value.  
When the RttMonRttType is 'pathEcho', this 
notification will only be sent when the threshold
violation occurs during an operation to the target and
not to a hop along the path to the target.  This also
applies to the subsiding of a threshold condition.
If History is not being collected, the instance values 
for the rttMonHistoryCollectionAddress object will not 
be valid.  When RttMonRttType is not 'echo' or 'pathEcho'
the rttMonHistoryCollectionAddress object will be null.

A rttMonVerifyErrorNotification indicates the 
occurrence of a data corruption in an RTT operation.
