This notification  signifies that there has been a change
in the state of FSPF neighbors. This is generated when 
the FSPF state regresses (e.g., goes from Full to init or 
Down) or progresses (e.g., from any  state to Full) to a 
terminal state. The value of 'fspfIfNbrState' is the state 
of the neighbor after the change.
Variables:
  1: ifIndex
  2: notifyVsanIndex
