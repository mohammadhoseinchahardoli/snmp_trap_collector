EVENT cdspMIBCardStateNotification .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.86.2.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A cdspMIBCardStateNotification is sent when the cdspCardState $*
SDESC
A cdspMIBCardStateNotification is sent when the cdspCardState
enters into normal(1) state and enters into or exits from
fatal(4) state.
Variables:
  1: cdspCardState
EDESC

EVENT cdspOperStateNotification .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.86.2.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A cdspOperStateNotification is sent when the cdspOperState $*
SDESC
A cdspOperStateNotification is sent when the cdspOperState
enters into normal(1) state or shutdown(2) state.
The value of entPhysicalName contains the name of the
DSP.
Variables:
  1: cdspOperState
  2: entPhysicalName

EVENT cdspVideoUsageNotification .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.86.2.0.3 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent when cdspCardVideoPoolUtilization $*
SDESC
This notification is sent when cdspCardVideoPoolUtilization
reaches the specified threshold 
(cdspCardVideoPoolUtilizationThreshold).
cdspCardVideoPoolUtilization indicates the DSP video pool usage
at the time this notification is sent.
cdspCardVideoPoolUtilizationThreshold indicates the threshold
configured to trigger this notification.
DSP video pool resource usage (cdspCardVideoPoolUtilization) is
updated and compared against the threshold
(cdspCardVideoPoolUtilizationThreshold) in the events below:
1.  A call that requires DSP video resource connects.
2.  A call that requires DSP video resource disconnects.
3.  DSPFarm profile for video resource is enabled.
4.  DSPFarm profile for video resource is disabled.
During comparison, if usage is larger than threshold, this 
notification is generated.
Variables:
  1: cdspCardVideoPoolUtilization
  2: cdspCardVideoPoolUtilizationThreshold

EVENT cdspVideoOutOfResourceNotification .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.86.2.0.4 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A cdspVideoOutOfResourceNotification is sent when there is not $*
SDESC
A cdspVideoOutOfResourceNotification is sent when there is not
enough DSP resource in the video pool of the system for video
services.
cdspCardVideoPoolUtilization indicates the DSP video pool usage
at the time this notification is sent.
cdspCardVideoPoolUtilizationThreshold indicates the threshold
configured to trigger this notification.
DSP video resources required is computed for each incoming call
that requires DSP video resources.  If there is not enough
video resource, this call will not have any video capabilities
and is treated as audio-only; and this notification is
generated.
Variables:
  1: cdspCardVideoPoolUtilization
  2: cdspCardVideoPoolUtilizationThreshold
