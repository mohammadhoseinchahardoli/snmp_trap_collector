EVENT cpwVcDown .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.106.2.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is generated when the $*
SDESC
This notification is generated when the
cpwVcOperStatus object for one or more contiguous
entries in cpwVcTable are about to enter the
down(2) state from some other state. The included values
of cpwVcOperStatus MUST all be set equal to this
down(2) state.  The two instances of cpwVcOperStatus
in this notification indicate the range of indexes
that are affected.  Note that all the indexes of the
two ends of the range can be derived from the
instance identifiers of these two objects.  For
cases where a contiguous range of cross-connects
have transitioned into the down(2) state at roughly
the same time, the device SHOULD issue a single
notification for each range of contiguous indexes in
an effort to minimize the emission of a large number
of notifications.  If a notification has to be
issued for just a single cross-connect entry, then
the instance identifier (and values) of the two
cpwVcOperStatus objects MUST be identical.

FORMAT This notification is generated when the $*
SDESC
This notification is generated when the
cpwVcOperStatus object for one or more contiguous
entries in cpwVcTable are about to enter the up(1)
state from some other state. The included values of
cpwVcOperStatus MUST both be set equal to this
new state (i.e: up(1)).  The two instances of 
cpwVcOperStatus in this notification indicate the range 
of indexes that are affected.  Note that all the indexes 
of the two ends of the range can be derived from the
instance identifiers of these two objects.  For
cases where a contiguous range of cross-connects
