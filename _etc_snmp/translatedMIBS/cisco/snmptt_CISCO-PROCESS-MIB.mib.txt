EVENT cpmCPURisingThreshold .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.2.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A cpmCPURisingThreshold notification is sent $*
SDESC
A cpmCPURisingThreshold notification is sent
when configured rising CPU utilization threshold
(cpmCPURisingThresholdValue) is reached and
CPU utilization remained above the threshold 
for configured interval(cpmCPURisingThresholdPeriod)
and such a notification is requested. 
The cpmProcExtUtil5SecRev and cpmProcessTimeCreated 
objects can be repeated multiple times
in a notification indicating the top users of CPU.
Variables:
  1: cpmCPURisingThresholdValue
  2: cpmCPUTotalMonIntervalValue
  3: cpmCPUInterruptMonIntervalValue
  4: cpmProcExtUtil5SecRev
  5: cpmProcessTimeCreated
