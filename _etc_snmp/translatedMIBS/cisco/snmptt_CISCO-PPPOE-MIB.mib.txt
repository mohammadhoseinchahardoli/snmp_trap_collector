EVENT cPppoeSystemSessionThresholdTrap .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.194.2.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A notification indicating that number of active  $*
SDESC
A notification indicating that number of active 
sessions on the system exceeded system sessions 
threshold value. System sessions threshold value 
is indicated by cPppoeSystemThresholdSessions. 
An  agent  must  not  generate  more  than  one
cPppoeSessionThresholdTrap `trap-event` in a
30 second period,  where a  `trap-event` is  the
transmission of a single trap  PDU to a  list of
trap destinations. If additional `the number of
PPPoE  sessions  exceeds  threshold`  condition
occur within the 30  second `throttling` period,
then these  trap-events should be suppressed by
the agent. An NMS should periodically check the
value of  cPppoeCurrSessions to  detect  any
missed cPppoeVcSessionThresholdTrap trap-events,
e.g. due to throttling or transmission loss.
Where 30 is the `throttling` period of trap-event.
