FORMAT This notification indicates that the device has reached its $*
SDESC
This notification indicates that the device has reached its
limit of number of connections it can optimize. No new
connections will be picked-up for optimization, while the device
is in this state.

EVENT cwoPeerOverload .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.762.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification indicates the device has reached its limit of $*
SDESC
This notification indicates the device has reached its limit of
number of peer devices with which it can optimize connections.
While the device is in this state, connections from new peer
device will not be picked-up for optimization.

EVENT cwoCpuThrottlingOn .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.762.0.3 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification indicates that the device has detected that $*
SDESC
This notification indicates that the device has detected that
the current CPU utilization (stored in
cpmCPUTotalMonIntervalValue) is higher than the
cwoGeneralCpuThrottleHigh. As a result the device has entered
into a throttling mode due to which connections under
optimization may experience slowdown. This notification is
generated the moment it occurs after a time lapse of 30 minutes
since the previous notification.

SDESC
This notification indicates that device has detected that the
CPU utilization of device (stored in
cpmCPUTotalMonIntervalValue) has fallen below the
cwoGeneralCpuThrottleLow from cwoGeneralCpuThrottleHigh. As a
result the device has come out of the throttling mode and there
should not be any negative impact of CPU usage on connection
under optimization. This notification is generated the moment it
occurs after a time lapse of 30 minutes since the previous
notification.
