EVENT ciscoTap2MIBActive .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.399.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This Notification is sent when an intercepting router or $*
SDESC
This Notification is sent when an intercepting router or
switch is first capable of intercepting a packet corresponding
to a configured data stream. The value of the corresponding 
cTap2StreamType which identifies the actual intercept stream
type is included in this notification.
This notification may be generated in conjunction with the
intercept application, which is designed to expect the
notification to be sent as reliably as possible, e.g., through
the use of a finite number of retransmissions until
acknowledged, as and when such mechanisms are available; for
example, with SNMPv3, this would be an InformRequest.  Filter
installation can take a long period of time, during which call
progress may be delayed.

EVENT ciscoTap2MediationTimedOut .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.399.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT When an intercept is autonomously removed by an intercepting $*
SDESC
When an intercept is autonomously removed by an intercepting
device, such as due to the time specified in
cTap2MediationTimeout arriving, the device notifies the manager
of the action.

EVENT ciscoTap2MediationDebug .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.399.0.3 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT When there is intervention needed due to some events related $*
SDESC
When there is intervention needed due to some events related
to entries configured in cTap2MediationTable, the device
notifies the manager of the event.
This notification may be generated in conjunction with the
intercept application, which is designed to expect the
notification to be sent as reliably as possible, e.g., through
the use of a finite number of retransmissions until
acknowledged, as and when such mechanisms are available; for
example, with SNMPv3, this would be an InformRequest.

When there is intervention needed due to some events related
to entries configured in cTap2StreamTable, the device
notifies the manager of the event.

EVENT ciscoTap2Switchover .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.399.0.5 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent when there is a redundant (standby) $*
SDESC
This notification is sent when there is a redundant (standby)
route processor available on the intercepting device and the
current active processor is going down causing standby to
takeover. Note that this notification may be sent by the
intercepting device only when it had a chance to know before it
goes down.
Mediation device when received this notification should assume 
that configured intercepts on the intercepting device no longer
exist, when the standby processor takes control. This means that
the Mediation device should again configure the intercepts.

EDESC
