EVENT ciscoMvpnMvrfChange .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.113.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A ciscoMvpnMvrfChange notification signifies a change about $*
SDESC
A ciscoMvpnMvrfChange notification signifies a change about
a MVRF in the device. The change event can be creation of 
the MVRF, deletion of the MVRF or an update on the default 
or data MDT configuration of the MVRF. The change event 
is indicated by ciscoMvpnGenOperStatusChange embedded in 
the notification. The user can then query 
ciscoMvpnGenericTable, ciscoMvpnMdtDefaultTable and/or 
ciscoMvpnMdtDataTable to get the details of the change as 
necessary.
Note: Since the creation of a MVRF is often followed by 
configuration of default and data MDT groups for the MVRF, 
more than one (three at most) notifications for a MVRF may 
be generated serially, and it is really not necessary to 
generate all three of them. An agent may choose to generate a 
notification for the last event only, that is for data MDT 
configuration.
Similarly, deletion of default or data MDT configuration on a 
MVRF happens before a MVRF is deleted, it is recommended 
that the agent send the notification for MVRF deletion 
event only.
