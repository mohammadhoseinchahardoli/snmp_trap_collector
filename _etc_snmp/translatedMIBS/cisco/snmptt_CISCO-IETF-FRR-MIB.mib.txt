This notification is generated when a tunnel running over an
interface as specified in the mplsFrrConstTable is initially
protected by the backup tunnel also specified in the
cmplsFrrConstTable. This notification should not be generated
for each subsequent tunnel that is backed up by the FRR feature
on this LSR, as this may result in potential scaling issues
with regard to LSR performance and network loading. Note also
that notifications MUST be generated in accordance with the
cmplsFrrNotifMaxRate.
