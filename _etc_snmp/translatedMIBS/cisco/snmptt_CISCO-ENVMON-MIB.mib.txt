SDESC
A ciscoEnvMonVoltageNotification is sent if the voltage 
measured at a given testpoint is outside the normal range 
for the testpoint (i.e. is at the warning, critical, or
shutdown stage).  Since such a notification is usually 
generated before the shutdown state is reached, it can 
convey more data and has a better chance of being sent 
than does the ciscoEnvMonShutdownNotification.
This notification is deprecated in favour of
ciscoEnvMonVoltStatusChangeNotif.
