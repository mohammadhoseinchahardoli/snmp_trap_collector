EVENT ciscoLwappMfpProtectConfigMismatch .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.518.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent by the agent when the $*
SDESC
This notification is sent by the agent when the
controller detects that the AP couldn't apply the
protection configuration to the specific radio
interface for the specified WLAN.  The controller
detects the mismatch by matching the MFP configuration
requested to be applied with the configuration 
returned in the acknowledgement as having been applied
to the radio interface. The controller also
generates this notification to indicate that 
configuration mismatch is cleared when the 
values of cLMfpProtectionEnable and
cLMfpApIfMfpProtectionActual are found to be the
same.
This notification is generated by the controller
only if MFP has been configured as the protection
mechanism through cLMfpProtectType.
Variables:
  1: cLApMacAddress
  2: cLApDot11IfSlotIdx
  3: cLWlanIdx

EVENT ciscoLwappMfpValidationConfigMismatch .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.518.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent by the agent when the $*
SDESC
This notification is sent by the agent when the
controller detects that the AP couldn't configure
itself with the MFP signature validation 
configuration.  The controller detects the mismatch by 
matching the MFP configuration requested to be applied
with the configuration returned in the acknowledgement
as having been configured by the AP.  The controller
also generates this notification to indicate that 
configuration mismatch is cleared when the values
of cLMfpApMfpValidationEnable and
cLMfpApMfpValidationActual are found to be the same.
This notification is generated by the controller
only if MFP has been configured as the protection
mechanism through cLMfpProtectType.

EVENT ciscoLwappMfpTimebaseStatus .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.518.0.3 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent by the agent to indicate $*
SDESC
This notification is sent by the agent to indicate
the controller's status of synchronization of its
timebase with that of a central timebase.  The
notification is sent once after the controller comes
up and thereafter, it is sent everytime the
status changes.

EVENT ciscoLwappMfpAnomalyDetected .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.518.0.4 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent by the agent when the $*
SDESC
This notification is sent by the agent when the
MFP configuration of the WLAN was violated by the 
radio interface cLApIfSmtDot11Bssid and detected by 
the radio interface cLApDot11IfSlotId of the AP 
cLApMacAddress.  The violation is indicated by
cLMfpEventType.
Through this notification, the controller reports
the NMS the occurrence of a total of cLMfpEventTotal
volation events, of type cLMfpEventType, upon
observing the management frame(s) indicated by
cLMfpEventFrames for the last cLMfpEventPeriod
time units.  When cLMfpEventTotal is 0, it
indicates that no further anomalies have recently
been detected and that the NMS should clear any
alarm raised about the MFP errors.
This notification is generated by the controller
only if MFP has been configured as the protection
mechanism through cLMfpProtectType.
Variables:
  1: cLApMacAddress
  2: cLApDot11IfSlotIdx
  3: cLApIfSmtDot11Bssid

EVENT ciscoLwappMfpAnomalyDetected1 .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.518.0.5 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent by the agent when the $*
SDESC
This notification is sent by the agent when the
MFP configuration of the WLAN was violated by the 
radio interface cLApIfSmtDot11Bssid and detected by 
the radio interface cLApDot11IfSlotId of the AP 
cLApMacAddress.  The violation is indicated by
cLMfpEventType.
Through this notification, the controller reports
the NMS the occurrence of a total of cLMfpEventTotal
volation events, of type cLMfpEventType, upon
observing the management frame(s) indicated by
cLMfpEventFrames for the last cLMfpEventPeriod
time units.  When cLMfpEventTotal is 0, it
indicates that no further anomalies have recently
been detected and that the NMS should clear any
alarm raised about the MFP errors.
cLClientLastSourceMacAddress is used only when the 
controller generates notifications about client-related 
attacks. The controller will populate zeros as the value 
for cLClientLastSourceMacAddress when reporting anomalies 
sourced by infrastructure devices.
This notification is generated by the controller
only if MFP has been configured as the protection
mechanism through cLMfpProtectType.
Variables:
  1: cLApMacAddress
  2: cLApDot11IfSlotIdx
