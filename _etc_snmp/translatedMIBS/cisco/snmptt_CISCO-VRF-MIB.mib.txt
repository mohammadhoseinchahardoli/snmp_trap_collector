EVENT cvVrfIfUp .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.711.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is generated when: $*
SDESC
This notification is generated when:
a. The ifOperStatus of an interface associated with a VRF
changes to the up(1) state.
b. When an interface with ifOperStatus = up(1) is 
associated with a VRF.
The interface is identified by ifName and the VRF is
identified by cvVrfName varbinds respectively.
Variables:
  1: ifName
  2: cvVrfName
  3: cvVrfOperStatus

EVENT cvVrfIfDown .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.711.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is generated when: $*
SDESC
This notification is generated when:
a. The ifOperStatus of an interface associated with a VRF 
changes to the down(2) state.
b. When an interface with ifOperStatus = up(1) state is 
disassociated with a VRF.
The interface is identified by ifName and the VRF is
identified by cvVrfName varbinds respectively.
If all the interfaces associated with the VRF are in down(2) 
state or if there are no more interfaces associated with the
VRF, then the cvVrfOperStatus will have a value of down(2).
