EVENT ccmSmtpServerFailNotif .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.300.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A ccmSmtpServerFailNotif is sent if the device fails on $*
SDESC
A ccmSmtpServerFailNotif is sent if the device fails on
sending an e-mail notification through an SMTP server in
ccmSmtpServersTable.
For each SMTP server, an agent should not generate more
than one ccmSmtpServerFailNotif 'notification-event'
in a given time interval (ten seconds is the suggested
default). A 'notification-event' is the transmission of
a single trap or inform PDU to a list of notification
destinations.
If within the throttling period, additional failures to
send a message through same server occur, then 
notification-events for these failure should be suppressed
by the agent until the current throttling period expires.
