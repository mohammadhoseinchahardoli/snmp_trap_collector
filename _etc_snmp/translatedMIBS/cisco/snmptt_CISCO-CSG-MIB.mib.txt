EVENT ciscoCsgAgentLostRecordEvent .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.331.0.4 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is issued when csgAgentNotifsEnabled $*
SDESC
This notification is issued when csgAgentNotifsEnabled
is set to 'true', and the CSG must discard accounting 
records that should be sent to the billing mediation
agent.
Initially, csgAgentLostRecords is set to 0.
When a record is discarded, csgAgentLostRecords 
is incremented, a period timer is started, and this 
notification is issued. The NMS and the agent save 
this value. The agent continues to increment 
csgAgentLostRecords each time a record is lost.  
When the period timer expires, the agent compares
the current value of csgAgentLostRecords with
the previous (saved) value. If the values are equal
this notification is issued again, signalling to the
NMS that the condition has been cleared. Otherwise,
the timer is restarted to monitor the next period.
When a record is lost and no period timer is active, 
this notification is issued and the above procedure 
is repeated.
Variables:
  1: csgAgentState
  2: csgAgentLostRecords
  3: csgAgentTotalSent
  4: csgAgentFailAck
  5: csgAgentOutstanding
