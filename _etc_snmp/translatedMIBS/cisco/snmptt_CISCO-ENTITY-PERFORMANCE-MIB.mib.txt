FORMAT A notification indicating that the specific performance $*
SDESC
A notification indicating that the specific performance
measurement is rising the configured threshold on this 
physical entity at a specific performance interval.
This notification will be sent, whenever the
cepStatsMeasurement is equal to or above the
cepConfigRisingThreshold for a specific performance
measurement at a specific interval and the
notification control objects are enabled.
An agent may throttle the generation of consecutive
cepPerfThreshRisingEvent notification so that
there is at least a five second (suggested default)
gap between notification for an entity of specific 
performance measurement type at a specific interval.
Variables:
  1: cepConfigPerfRange
  2: cepConfigRisingThreshold
  3: cepStatsMeasurement
