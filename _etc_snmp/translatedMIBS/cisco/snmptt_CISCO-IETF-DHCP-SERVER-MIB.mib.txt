FORMAT This notification signifies that a duplicate IPv4 address has $*
SDESC
This notification signifies that a duplicate IPv4 address has
been detected.  The DHCP server can detect this condition 
through the ping-before-offer mechanism.  Alternatively, the 
client may have sent a DHCPDECLINE back to the server; this is 
assumed to be the result of the client detecting that the 
address was in use.  In either case, the DHCP server marks the 
IPv4 address as unavailable for leasing to clients.  The 
cDhcpv4ServerNotifyClientOrServerDetected object indicates 
whether the client or server detected this condition.
Variables:
  1: cDhcpv4ServerNotifyDuplicateIpAddr
  2: cDhcpv4ServerNotifyDuplicateMac
