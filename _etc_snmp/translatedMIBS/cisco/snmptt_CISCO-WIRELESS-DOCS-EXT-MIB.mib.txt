EVENT cwdxHeSuChOverNotification .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.169.2.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent at the completion of a HE  $*
SDESC
This notification is sent at the completion of a HE 
channel override operation if 
cwdxHeSuChOverTrapOnCompletion is true in the
original entry.
Once a channel override operation has been activated, it 
cannot be stopped.  That is, it will run until either the 
HE has generated downstream frequency and/or upstream 
channel override fields in the RNG-RSP message sent to a 
HE or cwdxHeSuChOverTimeExpiration time expired.
In either case, the operation is completed. State in the 
cwdxHeSuChOverState object will tell in which 
condition the operation is completed.
Variables:
  1: cwdxHeSuChOverMacAddress
  2: cwdxHeSuChOverDownFrequency
  3: cwdxHeSuChOverUpChannelId
  4: cwdxHeSuChOverOpInitiatedTime
  5: cwdxHeSuChOverState
