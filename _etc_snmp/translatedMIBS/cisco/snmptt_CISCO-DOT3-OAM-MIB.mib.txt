EVENT cdot3OamThresholdEvent .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.136.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A cdot3OamThresholdEvent notification is sent when a local or $*
SDESC
A cdot3OamThresholdEvent notification is sent when a local or
remote threshold crossing event is detected.  A local
threshold crossing event is detected by the local entity,
while a remote threshold crossing event is detected by the
reception of an Ethernet OAM Event Notification OAMPDU
indicating a threshold event.  
This notification should not be sent more than once per
second.
The OAM entity can be derived from extracting the ifIndex from
the variable bindings.  The objects in the notification
correspond to the values in a row instance of in the
cdot3OamEventLogTable.  
The management entity should periodically check
cdot3OamEventLogTable to detect any missed events.

FORMAT A cdot3OamNonThresholdEvent notification is sent when a local $*
SDESC
A cdot3OamNonThresholdEvent notification is sent when a local
or remote non-threshold crossing event is detected.  A local
event is detected by the local entity, while a remote event is
detected by the reception of an Ethernet OAM Event
Notification OAMPDU indicating a non-threshold crossing event.  
This notification should not be sent more than once per
second.
