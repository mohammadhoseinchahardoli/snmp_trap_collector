EVENT ciscoBfdSessUp .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.137.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is generated when the $*
SDESC
This notification is generated when the
ciscoBfdSessState object for one or more contiguous 
entries in ciscoBfdSessTable are about to enter the up(4) 
state from some other state. The included values of 
ciscoBfdSessDiag MUST both be set equal to this 
new state (i.e: up(4)).  The two instances of  
ciscoBfdSessDiag in this notification indicate the range  
of indexes that are affected.  Note that all the indexes  
of the two ends of the range can be derived from the 
instance identifiers of these two objects.  For the 
cases where a contiguous range of sessions 
have transitioned into the up(4) state at roughly 
the same time, the device SHOULD issue a single 
notification for each range of contiguous indexes in 
an effort to minimize the emission of a large number 
of notifications.  If a notification has to be 
issued for just a single ciscoBfdSessEntry, then 
the instance identifier (and values) of the two 
ciscoBfdSessDiag objects MUST be the identical.
Variables:
  1: ciscoBfdSessDiag
  2: ciscoBfdSessDiag
