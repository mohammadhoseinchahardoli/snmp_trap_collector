FORMAT This notification is generated whenever a  $*
SDESC
This notification is generated whenever a 
trace route test is completed and the
corresponding instance of 
fcTraceRouteTrapOnCompletion is set to 'true'.
The agent is encouraged to append, at the end 
of this notification's varbindlist, one varbind
for each hop of the traced route. Each such
appended varbind would contain an instance of
fcTraceRouteHopsHopAddr object. If the number of
varbinds required would cause the notification
to approach it's maximum size, the number of
instances of fcTraceRouteHopsHopAddr will be
truncated suitably.
Variables:
  1: fcTraceRouteTargetAddr
  2: fcTraceRouteOperStatus
