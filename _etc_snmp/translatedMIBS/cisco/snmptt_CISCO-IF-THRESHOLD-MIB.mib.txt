EVENT cifthIfThresholdFired .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.218.2.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT The agent generates this notification when a threshold defined $*
SDESC
The agent generates this notification when a threshold defined
in a template is asserted on an interface.
If a threshold is asserted for a given interface and template,
cifthTemplateNotifyHoldDownTime is set to 'holdDownTimer' for
that template, and this notification has recently been sent for
the same threshold on the same interface, then this
notification may be suppressed.

EVENT cifthIfThresholdCleared .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.218.2.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT The agent generates this notification when a threshold, that $*
SDESC
The agent generates this notification when a threshold, that
has previously fired, is cleared on an interface.
If a threshold is cleared for a given interface and template,
cifthTemplateNotifyHoldDownTime is set to 'holdDownTimer' for
that template, and this notification has recently been sent for
the same threshold on the same interface, then this
notification may be suppressed.

EVENT cifthTemplateIfStatusChange .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.218.2.0.3 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT The agent generates this notification when a template comes up $*
SDESC
The agent generates this notification when a template comes up
or goes down on an interface to which it is assigned, i.e.,
when the value of cifthTemplateIfAssignOperStatus changes.  If
a template becomes operationally down on an interface upon
activation of a new entry in the cifthTemplateIfAssignTable,
the agent generates this notification.  The agent need not
generate this notification when a new entry in the
cifthTemplateIfAssignTable is activated, if the template
becomes operational on the interface.  The agent need not
generate this notification when an entry in the
cifthTemplateIfAssignTable is destroyed.
