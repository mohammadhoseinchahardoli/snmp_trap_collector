EVENT ciscoGrtDestStateChange .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.334.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is generated whenever one or more $*
SDESC
This notification is generated whenever one or more
destination changes states. This notification 
contains a list of destination state changes in the
cgrtDestNotifChanges object.  State changes are
accumulated until the cgrtDestNotifChanges is 
full or the maximum delay time is reached.  The delay
time is specified by the cgrtDestNotifDelayTime 
object.
It may be necessary to suppress the sending of 
notification when a large number destinations change 
state, due the failure of some common resource.  The 
number of notifications can be controlled by 
specifying values for cgrtDestNotifWindowTime 
and cgrtDestNotifMaxPerWindow objects.  When the 
number of destination state changes exceed the 
specified value the last notification will indicate 
that notifications are suppressed for the remainder
of the window.
This notification is deprecated by 
ciscoGrtDestStateChangeRev1.

This notification is generated whenever one or more
management routes change state.  This notification
contains a list of management route state changes 
in the cgrtMgmtNotifChanges object.  State changes 
are accumulated until the cgrtMgmtNotifChanges
is full or the maximum delay time is reached.  The 
delay time is specified by the 
cgrtMgmtNotifDelayTime object.

notification when a large number of routes change 
state, due the failure of some common resource.
The number of notifications can be controlled by

number of route state changes exceed the specified
value the last notification will indicate that
notifications are suppressed for the remainder
of the window.

FORMAT This notification is generated whenever a load  $*
SDESC
This notification is generated whenever a load 
operation is started or completed.  Route table
configurations can be loaded by CLI requests. 
In addition, route tables can loaded using
configuration statements.  This allows route
tables to be reloaded whenever a device restarts.

SDESC
This notification is generated whenever one or more
destination changes states within the 
cgrtDestNotifWindowTimeRev1 duration.  Latest state 
information at the end of cgrtDestNotifWindowTimeRev1
is provided.
It may be necessary to suppress the sending of
notification when a large number destinations change
state, due the failure of some common resource.  The
number of notifications can be controlled by
specifying values for cgrtDestNotifWindowTimeRev1
and cgrtDestNotifMaxPerWindowRev1 objects.  When the
number of destination state changes exceed the
specified value, the notification will provide a  
count of notifications that got suppressed for the 
remainder of the window.
This notification deprecates ciscoGrtDestStateChange.

FORMAT This notification is generated whenever one or more $*
SDESC
This notification is generated whenever one or more
MSU discards happen due to route data error for a
specific signalling point instance in the configured
cgrtNoRouteMSUsNotifWindowTime.  For cases when there
is a non-zero number of MSUs discarded, this
notification will be sent at the end of the
cgrtNoRouteMSUsNotifWindowTime interval, with
cgrtIntervalNoRouteMSUs indicating the total count of
MSUs discarded for that specific signalling point
instance during the entire cgrtNoRouteMSUsNotifWindowTime
interval Q752/5.5.
