EVENT cItpRouteStateChange .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.228.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is generated whenever one or more $*
SDESC
This notification is generated whenever one or more
route destination status changes states and includes
the count of all route state changes.  This 
notification contains a list of route state changes
in the cItpRtNotifInfoStateChanges object.  State
changes are accumulated until the 
cItpRtNotifInfoStateChanges is full or the maximum
delay time is reached.  The delay time is specified
by the cItpRtChangeNotifDelayTime object.
It may be necessary to suppress the sending of 
notification when a large number route change 
state, due the failure of some common resource.
The number of notifications can be controlled by 
specifying values for cItpRtChangeNotifWindowTime 
and cItpRtChangeNotifMaxPerWindow objects. When the 
number of route state changes exceed the specified
value the last notification will indicate that
notifications are suppressed for the remainder
of the window.
