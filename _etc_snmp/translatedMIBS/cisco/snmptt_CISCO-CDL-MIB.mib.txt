EVENT coCdlRxAggDefectIndChange .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.88.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent when the value of the hop-by-hop $*
SDESC
This notification is sent when the value of the hop-by-hop
forward defect indication (FDI-H), hop-by-hop backward defect
indication (BDI-H), or end-to-end (aggregate path) forward
defect indication (FDI-E) bit received on an interface changes.
To minimize the probability of prematurely reacting to
momentary signal variations, a soak time may be incorporated
into the notification in the following manner. A notification
is generated after a defect is first detected, when the defect
persists for a period of time that exceeds the set soak
interval specified by coCdlDefectIndSetSoakInterval. A
notification is generated after a defect stops being detected,
when the defect does not appear over a period of time that
exceeds the clear soak interval specified by
coCdlDefectIndClearSoakInterval.
When changes in CDL defect indications are received for
multiple interfaces within a short time span, notifications
should be deferred so that each notification is generated at
least one coCdlDINotifyThrottleInterval after the previous
notification.

EVENT coCdlFromCdlNetFlowDIChange .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.88.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent when the value of the received $*
SDESC
This notification is sent when the value of the received
end-to-end path forward defect indication or the received
end-to-end path backward defect indication changes.
Note that the end-to-end path forward defect indication is
implicit, i.e. it is not signalled using a bit. An end-to-end
path forward defect is inferred when no CDL Ethernet or Idle
packets are received over a pre-determined length of time.
To minimize the probability of prematurely reacting to
momentary signal variations, a soak time may be incorporated
into the notification in the following manner. A notification
is generated after a defect is first detected, when the defect
persists for a period of time that exceeds the set soak
interval specified by coCdlDefectIndSetSoakInterval. A
notification is generated after a defect stops being detected,
when the defect does not appear over a period of time that
exceeds the clear soak interval specified by
coCdlDefectIndClearSoakInterval.

multiple interfaces within a short time span, notifications
should be deferred so that each notification is generated at
