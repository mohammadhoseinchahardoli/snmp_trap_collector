EVENT ciscoBitsClockFreerun .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.459.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT An external clock source is unavailable.  The internal  $*
SDESC
An external clock source is unavailable.  The internal 
clock will operate in freerun mode using appropiate 
local oscillator. Therefore, it does not provide 
synchronous clocking. This is the least stable of 
all operating modes.

EVENT ciscoBitsClockHoldover .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.459.0.3 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT An external clock source is unavailable. The internal  $*
SDESC
An external clock source is unavailable. The internal 
clock will operate in holdover mode. The network clock 
module has stored information about the incoming clock
signal, it can faithfully reproduce the lost signal 
while in holdover mode until a switchover to 
another clock source occurs.
