If a Domain ID is not configured or assigned on a 
VSAN, then the switch may isolate E_ports on that 
VSAN. The conditions are : 
- If the Domain Manager is enabled on the local 
switch and its request for a configured static 
Domain ID is rejected or no other Domain ID is 
assigned, then the E_ports are isolated.
- If the domain manager is not enabled and if a 
static Domain ID is not configured on the VSAN, 
then the switch will isolate all of its E_ports 
on the VSAN.
This notification contains the vsanIndex of the VSAN 
on which the condition happened.

FORMAT $*
SDESC

This notification indicates that the sending switch 
has become the new Principal Switch on a VSAN. This 
notification is sent soon after its election as the 
new Principal Switch, i.e., upon expiration of a 
Principal Switch selection timer which is equal to 
twice Fabric  Stability Timeout value (F_S_TOV).
This notification contains the vsanIndex of the VSAN 
on which the switch became the Principal Switch and 
the WWN of the switch which became the Principal 
Switch.

FORMAT $*
SDESC

This notification is sent whenever a switch sends or 
receives a Build Fabric (BF) or a ReConfigure Fabric 
(RCF) message on a VSAN.
A switch can receive or issue a BuildFabric (BF) or a 
ReConfigureFabric (RCF) message under following 
conditions:
- A new link causes two disjoint fabrics in a VSAN to 
merge into one fabric. The sent/received message is
BF if the Domain ID lists on the disjoint fabric 
does not overlap and it is RCF if they overlap.
- An upsteam principal ISL which connects to Principal
switch and other switches in a VSAN fails. BF is
issued to see if there is an alternative path to
the Principal Switch. If not paths exit, then an RCF
is issued.
- A switch asks for a different set of Domain IDs 
than the currently assigned list, the Principal 
switch would issue an RCF.
The notification is not sent if a 
'dmNewPrincipalSwitchNotify' notification is sent
for the same transition.
This notification contains the vsanIndex of the VSAN 
on which RCF was issued.
