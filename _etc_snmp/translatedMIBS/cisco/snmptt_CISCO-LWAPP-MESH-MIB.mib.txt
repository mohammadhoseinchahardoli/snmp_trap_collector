EVENT ciscoLwappMeshAuthFailure .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.616.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT A mesh node can fail to authorize if the MAC address $*
SDESC
A mesh node can fail to authorize if the MAC address
of mesh node is not in the MAC filter list or security 
failure by authentication server. Reason is specified by 
'clMeshAuthFailureReason'. This notification is sent by 
the agent when number of failures exceeds threshold 
defined by object 'clMeshMeshNodeAuthFailureThreshold'. 
Object 'clMeshAuthFailureNotifEnabled' controls the 
generation of this notification.
Variables:
  1: clMeshNodeMacAddress
  2: clMeshAuthFailureReason

EVENT ciscoLwappMeshChildExcludedParent .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.616.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification will be sent by agent when child $*
SDESC
This notification will be sent by agent when child
mesh node exceeds threshold limit of number of 
discovery response timeouts defined by object 
'clMeshMeshChildAssociationFailuresThreshold'. The 
child mesh node will not try to associate excluded 
parent mesh node for the interval defined by object 
'clMeshMeshChildExcludedParentInterval'.
The child mesh node will remember the excluded parent 
MAC address and when it joins the network it will 
inform the controller.  
'cLApName' specifies child mesh node name. Child MAC 
address is sent as part of index. Object 
'clMeshChildExcludedParentNotifEnabled' controls the 
generation of this notification.
Variables:
  1: clMeshNodeParentMacAddress
  2: clMeshPreviousParentMacAddress

#
EVENT ciscoLwappMeshParentChange .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.616.0.3 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent by the agent when a child $*
SDESC
This notification is sent by the agent when a child
mesh node changes its parent. Child mesh node will 
remember its previous parent and when it joins the 
network it will inform controller about change 
of its parent. 'cLApName' specifies child mesh node 
name. Child mesh node MAC address is sent as part of 
index. Object 'clMeshParentChangeNotifEnabled' controls 
the generation of this notification.

EVENT ciscoLwappMeshChildMoved .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.616.0.4 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent by the agent when a parent $*
SDESC
This notification is sent by the agent when a parent
mesh node loses connection with its child mesh node. 
'cLApName' specifies parent mesh node name. Parent and 
child MAC address are sent as part of index. Object 
'clMeshChildMovedNotifEnabled' controls 
the generation of this notification.
Variables:
  1: clMeshNeighborType
  2: cLApName

EVENT ciscoLwappMeshExcessiveParentChange .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.616.0.5 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent by the agent when child $*
SDESC
This notification is sent by the agent when child
mesh node changes its parent frequently. Each 
mesh node keeps count of number of parent changes 
in fixed time. If it exceeds the threshold defined 
by 'clMeshExcessiveParentChangeThreshold' then child 
mesh node informs the controller. 'cLApName' specifies 
child mesh node name. Child and Parent MAC address are 
sent as part of index. Object 
'clMeshExcessiveParentChangeNotifEnabled' controls 
the generation of this notification.

  1: clMeshNeighborType

EVENT ciscoLwappMeshOnsetSNR .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.616.0.6 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent by the agent when child $*
SDESC
This notification is sent by the agent when child
mesh node detects lower SNR on backhaul link then 
defined by object 'clMeshSNRThresholdOnset'. SNR 
value is checked after interval defined by object 
'clMeshSNRCheckTimeInterval'. 
'ciscoLwappMeshAbateSNR' notification will be sent 
to clear this notification. 'cLApName' specifies 
child mesh node name. Child and parent MAC address 
are sent as part of index. Object 
'clMeshPoorSNRNotifEnabled' controls the generation 
of this notification.
Variables:
  1: clMeshNeighborLinkSnr
  2: cLApName

EVENT ciscoLwappMeshAbateSNR .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.616.0.7 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent by the agent to clear $*
SDESC
This notification is sent by the agent to clear
'ciscoLwappMeshOnsetSNR' notification when child mesh 
node detects SNR on backhaul link is higher then
the object defined by 'clMeshSNRThresholdAbate'. SNR 
value is checked after interval defined by object 
'clMeshSNRCheckTimeInterval'. 
'cLApName' specifies child mesh node name.
Child and parent MAC address are sent as part of index.
Object 'clMeshPoorSNRNotifEnabled' controls the 
generation of this notification.

EVENT ciscoLwappMeshConsoleLogin .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.616.0.8 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification is sent by the agent when login on $*
SDESC
This notification is sent by the agent when login on
MAP console is successful or failure after three
attempts. 'cLApName' specifies mesh node name.
Object 'clMeshPoorSNRNotifEnabled' controls the 
generation of this notification.
Variables:
  1: clMeshNodeMacAddress
  2: clMeshConsoleLoginStatus
