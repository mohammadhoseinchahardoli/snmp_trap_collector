EVENT ciscoErmGlobalPolicyViolation .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.510.0.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification event will be generated whenever system $*
SDESC
This notification event will be generated whenever system
global resource policy is violated i.e. total resource
utilization exceeds the applied global threshold limit for
any resource owner sub-type. Also, this notificatioin will be
generated when resource utilization of the affected resource
owner sub-type falls below the corresponding falling threshold
value.
The cermResOwnerName and cermResOwnerSubTypeName objects
indicates the resource owner name and resource owner sub-type
name for which an applied global threshold value got violated.
The cermNotifsThresholdSeverity object indicates the configured
threshold severity which got violated. This object contains
value of the cermResOwnerSubTypeThreshSeverity corresponding
to the global threshold configuration which got violated.
The cermNotifsThresholdValue object indicates the configured
threshold limit which got violated. This object contains value
of either cermResOwnerSubTypeRisingThresh or
cermResOwnerSubTypeFallingThresh based on the ERM notification
direction indicated by the object cermNotifsDirection.
If the cermNotifsDirection object value is 'up', the
cermNotifsThresholdValue object would contain the value of
the object cermResOwnerSubTypeRisingThresh. If the
cermNotifsDirection object value is 'down', the
cermNotifsThresholdValue object would contain the value of
the object cermResOwnerSubTypeFallingThresh.
The cermNotifsDirection object indicates whether it is
an 'up' notification or a 'down' notification.
The cermNotifsPolicyName object indicates name of the global
resource policy which got violated. This object contains
value of the cermPolicyName for the violated resource policy,
in the cermConfigPolicyTable. If there is no associated
resource policy name for the notification, then this object
will contain zero-length string.

EVENT ciscoErmLocalPolicyViolation .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.510.0.2 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT This notification event will be generated whenever a local $*
SDESC
This notification event will be generated whenever a local
resource policy is violated i.e. resource utilization exceeds
the applied user local or per user global threshold limit
for any resource owner sub-type <-> resource user relationship.
The cermResOwnerName and cermResOwnerSubTypeName objects
indicates the resource owner name and resource owner sub-type
name for which an applied per user global or user local
threshold value got violated.
The cermResUserOrGroupThreshFlag object indicates whether
the ERM notification is because of *resource user* threshold
violation or *resource group* threshold violation.
The cermNotifsThresholdIsUserGlob object indicates whether
the notification belongs to Per User Global threshold
violation or User Local threshold violation. This object
contains the value of cermResUserOrGroupThreshIsUserGlob 
corresponding to the threshold configuration which got
violated.
The cermNotifsThresholdValue object indicates the configured
threshold limit which got violated. This object contains
value of either cermResUserOrGroupRisingThresh or
cermResUserOrGroupFallingThresh based on the ERM notification
direction indicated by the object cermNotifsDirection. For
the 'up' notification, this object would contain value of
the object cermResUserOrGroupRisingThresh. For the 'down'
notification, it would contain value of the object
cermResUserOrGroupFallingThresh.
The cermNotifsThresholdSeverity object indicates the
configured threshold severity which got violated. This object
contains value of the object cermResUserOrGroupThreshSeverity
corresponding to the resource owner sub-type and resource user
relationship.
The cermNotifsDirection object indicates whether it is an
'up' notification or a 'down' notification.
The cermNotifsPolicyName object indicates name of the local
resource policy which got violated. If there is no associated
policy name for the notification, then this object will
contain zero-length string.
