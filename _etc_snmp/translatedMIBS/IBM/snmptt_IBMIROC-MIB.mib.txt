FORMAT When the routing subsystem ELS component is configured to $*
SDESC
When the routing subsystem ELS component is configured to
generate SNMP traps, the following trap is generated.
It contains a single varBind containing a text string in one
of the two following formats.
If ELS timestamping is enabled:
hr:min:sec subsys_name.event_num: message_text
For example - 09:32:56 IP.008: no rte 9.7.1.8 -> 9.7.4.3 dsc
If ELS timestamping is disabled:
subsys_name.event_num: message_text
For example - IP.008: no rte 9.7.1.8 -> 9.7.4.3 dsc
NOTE: The following subsystems cannot have their events sent
in SNMP traps (ARP, ICMP, UDP, SNMP and IP (excluding
IP access control events)). This restriction is due to the
fact that these subsystems are involved in sending an SNMP
trap and allowing them could cause an infinite loop in the
router software.
